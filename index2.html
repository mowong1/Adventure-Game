            <p>You are able to stay hidden long enough till the panda goes out of the cave to find some food to eat. While he goes out, you run out of the cave because you don't want to be caught still in the cave when it comes back. When you get out of the cave, you find out this is not the way you came in. You must have made a different turn somewhere while taking all those pictures. You don't want to waste too much time figuring out which way to go. There are only two paths and there is a sign that says they both lead to California, so it doesn't matter. The panda must have taken one so you want to take the other one. Which one do you pick? The left one or the right one. </p>
